(decision question)\n\nAssuming: \"Should I add to my portfolio at current price?\"\n\n**LAYER 2 (Echo Prime)**:\n- RATIONALIST: P/E ~28. Is revenue growth (5%) justified? Probably not—overvalued.\n- EMPIRICIST: Historical: Apple peaks and corrects every 2-3 years. Could drop 20-30%.\n- PHENOMENOLOGICAL: Investors love Apple brand. Psychological support strong.\n- SYSTEMIC: Dependent on China, consumer spending, smartphone cycle.\n- QUANTUM: ML signals mixed—tech sector momentum fading.\n\n**LAYER 3 (Parallel Pathways)**:\n- CONSERVATIVE: Wait for pullback to $150 (20% lower)\n- PROBABLE: Enter on any 5-10% dip, set target $200\n- OPTIMISTIC: Already in—hold and ignore noise\n\n**LAYER 4 (Echo Resonance)**:\nFrameworks mostly agree: Good company, but price too high now. Better entry coming.\n\n**LAYER 5 (Real-Time Data)**:\nChecking: Any earnings coming? Product launches? Macro signals? (Would update recommendations)\n\n**LAYER 6 (Echo Vision)**:\nYour target: If building 10-year portfolio, doesn't matter if entry is $170 or $150. Time in > timing.\n\n**LAYER 7 (Temporal Anchoring)**:\nIf 6-month horizon: Wait for pullback. If 10-year: Can buy gradually regardless of price.\n\n**RECOMMENDATION**: Wait for pullback, or buy small and add on dips. Don't chase at current price."

It's maximum return without losing sleep. If you're stressed about portfolio, you haven't diversified enough."
