2. **Educational Institutions** (Universities + colleges): $1.2B
3. **Coaching & Consulting** (Career/life coaches): $800M
4. **Healthcare Providers** (Hospitals + clinics): $600M

### Early Adopter Profile

**Primary Decision Maker:** VP of Talent/HR, Chief People Officer
**Budget Authority:** $50K-500K annually (depending on org size)
**Pain Point:** High turnover (average 15-20% annually costs 50-200% of salary per person)
**Success Metric:** 3-5% reduction in turnover = $2-5M ROI for 1000-employee organization

---

## The Problem

### Current Landscape

**Employee Turnover Crisis:**
- Average US turnover rate: 16.2% annually
- Cost of replacing one employee: 50-200% of annual salary
- For Fortune 500 company with 10,000 employees: **$400M-$1.6B annually** in turnover costs

**Prediction Blindness:**
- HR departments lack visibility into who will leave
- Career counselors make recommendations without data
- No quantified risk assessment for major life decisions
- Employees make decisions based on intuition, not data

**Decision Support Gap:**
- Career changers don't know their true earning potential in new field
- Couples therapy provides no trajectory insight
- Healthcare providers can't predict patient outcomes
- Real estate advisors estimate based on experience, not algorithms

### Current Solutions (Inadequate)

| Solution | Limitations |
|----------|------------|
| Surveys & assessments | Lag indicators, subjective interpretation |
| Exit interviews | Data only available after departure |
| Market salary databases | Salary only; doesn't predict trajectory |
| Career aptitude tests | Identify strengths; don't project outcomes |
| HR analytics platforms | Retention prediction only; limited domains |
